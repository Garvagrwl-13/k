            <h2> The Creator of the website says:</h2>
            <p> Hurray! The moment is finally here. It's your English Exam. I understand how you are feeling right now.</p>
            <p>I know you have prepared well. (Well, if you think you haven't prepared well, then you must believe it).</p>
            <p> Last minute advice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Keep all stationary ready. Admit Card, exam board, pen, pencil, eraser, scale, sharpner, water bottle, etc.</li>
                <li> Take enough sleep now.</li>
                <li> Before exam, eat very light.</li>
                <li> Eat a spoon of Dahi and Khaand(sugar/bura) before leaving home.</li>
                <li> On the day of exam, Revise at home early morning. Avoid studying 1-2 hrs before exam.</li>
                <li> Don't talk much before the exam. So, that you are in your headspace.</li>
                <li> Take a deep breath.</li>
                <li> Reach the exam centre on time. (Don't go late like you used to go to School)<ul> <li>It will cause panic if you reach late.</li>
                <li>On reaching the centre, close your eyes and relax.</li></ul></li>
                <li> Avoid discussing paper after exam. Enjoy with friends. Motivate them. Forget about it and prepare for the next one.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p> The most important thing during any exam is that one must remain calm. Give your best. Being in a hurry and having a good speed are two different things. Drink water. Focus on your paper only. Read questions carefully. Utilise the question paper reading time. </p>
            <p> All the best. Go smiling and leave smiling.</p>
